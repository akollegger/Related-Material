Markdown Conventions
====================

Headers
-------

### Level 1 Header

The first level 1 header is considered to be the title of the document.
Accordingly, the title of this document is "Markdown Conventions". 

Subsequent level 1 headers (all but the first) are section dividers.

## Idiomatic phrases

An idiomatic phrase is a word or more that, by convention, refer to a specific
idea for people who are _"in the know"_ that might otherwise not have much
clear meaning. This is the kind of language that someone might be tempted to 
use air-quotes when speaking, so naturally they can be identified as a quoted 
phrase in italics. You can use any style of italics, either immediately inside 
or outside of double quotes.

For example: 

We call these _"clever insider terms"_ by the phrase "*idiomatic phrases*". 

Idiotmatic phrase definition
----------------------------

When providing the definition for an "_idiomatic phrase_", couple the phrase
directly to the explanatory text with either an em dash or a colon. Like so:

* One coupling is to use an "_em dash_" --- three dashes in a row.
* An alternative is the "_colon_" : a typographical symbol used to show what follows. 


Punctuation
===========

Periods
-------

Periods should only be used to end a complete sentence. 


Quotes
------

Spoken quotations "should include ending punction inside of the end quote,"
according to me.

However, non-spoken text that uses quotes as a delimiter should have punctuation
outside, to clarify that the punctuation is "Not Part of The Title".
